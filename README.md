# FitLit

## Introduction
-  Fitness tracker dashboard called FitLit where a user can track all of their activities in once place. A user is able to see their daily step goals in comparison to other users. They are also able to track sleep habits and water intake in one convenient place.
- This was our first project reaching out to several APIs to gather and correlate seperate datasets.
- EDIT - I (Catalyst) have taken the orginal group project and cleaned up the CSS as a personal endeavor.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Mocha & Chai
- Webpack
- Charts.js

## Illustrations
- A user should be able to show and hide their personal data:
![user icon changes from name to personal info when clicked ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Catalyst4Change/2fit2lit/main/src/images/2fit_userinfo.gif)
- The dashboard is responsive to screen size.
![the screen shifts from multiple columns to a single scrollable column on a smaller screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Catalyst4Change/2fit2lit/main/src/images/2fit_responsive.gif)

## Features
- User can show/hide their personal data (MVP requirement)
- Display a user's health data and compare their daily step goals to the average steps goals of users.
- Display user's friends.
- Allows a user to track sleep goals and hydration goals.

## Possible Future Extensions
- Dashboard display for admin view. Create new HTML page that shows the data and trends from all users.

## Challenges
- Understanding the overall vastness of this project since it is significantly more complex than anything we have done during this program.
- Navigating the class to class interactions once classes and tests were written.
